**BIOS:** SCPH-1001 (USA) retail BIOS, 524288 bytes, SHA-256 `71af94d1e47a68c11e8fdb9f8368040601514a42a5a399cda48c7d3bff1e99d3`. Supply your own dump; releases do not use OpenBIOS.

## RetComM Launcher

You can run this title **standalone** (release zip + the built-in recomp-ui
Generate & Build flow), or manage installs, updates, ROM/BIOS wiring, and queued
builds more intuitively with
**[RetComM Launcher](https://github.com/TechnicallyComputers/RetComM-Launcher)** —
the Retro Compilation Manager hub for self-compiling recomps.

RetComM checks for updates, rebuilds with existing build data when possible,
uses the same platform build tools as per-title launchers, and automates
BIOS/ROM/save plumbing so you are not stuck repeating each game’s wizard by hand.

## Legal

You must own the original game. Disc images under `disc/` are gitignored and
must never be committed. This package requires a legal SCPH-1001 BIOS dump.
OpenBIOS is not supported. Retail BIOS dumps are not redistributed.

## License

Project-owned source, scripts, configuration, and documentation use
`GPL-3.0-only`. See `LICENSE`.

This license does not cover Xena: Warrior Princess content, generated retail
code, artwork, names, or trademarks. PSXRecomp remains under PolyForm
Noncommercial 1.0.0. `recomp-ui` remains under MIT. See
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and each submodule license.

Default app icon: `assets/psxrecomp.ico` (and `.png` / `.svg`) — RetComM-themed controller mark from `psxrecomp/assets/`. Windows builds embed it via `APP_ICON`.

Optional box art under `launcher_assets/img/` may come from
[libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails)
(`Named_Boxarts`); see `BOXART_SOURCE.txt` when present.

## Quick start (dev)

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
./psxrecomp/tools/ci/build_emitters.sh
python3 psxrecomp/psxrecomp_cli.py generate \
  --config game.toml --project-root . --disc disc/<your>.cue \
  --bios /path/to/SCPH1001.BIN
cmake -S . -B build-release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-release --target psx-runtime
```

Zip prefix for CI artifacts: `xena-warrior-princess-recomp`.

## Validation

The source repository keeps release evidence in `docs/VALIDATION.md`. A build
is not a public release until its exact package passes every listed gate. A
headless boot test does not replace a full gameplay test.

## Symbols

Progressive map: `symbols.toml` → `python3 tools/sync_symbols.py` →
`psx_symbols.h` (`PSX_FN_*`). See `psxrecomp/docs/SYMBOLS.md`.

## Framework pins

Submodule gitlinks (`psxrecomp`, optional `recomp-ui`, nested `recomp-net`)
are authoritative. `framework_pins.txt` is an optional scaffold snapshot;
release CI logs SHAs with `record_pins.sh` but builds whatever the gitlinks
resolve to. Bump submodules deliberately — do not float on `main`/`master`
in release CI.

## About this project

These ports are developed by a hobbyist (a DevSecOps engineer, not a game
programmer) with substantial AI assistance. Every change is validated before
it ships. The checks include boot gates, hardware-oracle comparisons,
deterministic probes, and a shared findings registry. AI writes most of the
code. The evidence decides what stays. Bug reports are welcome.

In short: AI writes the code, but I always test it before I publish it.

## v0.1.1 three-platform candidate

This candidate targets Windows x64, Linux x64, macOS ARM64, and macOS x64.
These setup packages require your legally owned game disc and a supported
regional retail BIOS. They remain unpublished until their exact package tests
and release authorization pass.
